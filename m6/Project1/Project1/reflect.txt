During milestone 1, I was so frustrated that I couldn't fix my memory leak.
After going through my codes and debugged my code line by line, I was able to fix
my memory leak and was able to submit one day late. After spending about 20 hours
of debugging, the next time when I was writing my code, I never forget that time spent
and always deallocated memories that I created. That is something that I learned through
out the milestone. Also, it took me some time to understand the concept of inheritance
and how base and derived class connect each other and what can read or modify its 
their data. But after going through the lecture notes and some research about what 
inheritances are for and how it is used, I was able to create my project structure to 
combine one another. And lastly, the virtual function method was very useful for me 
because once virtual function is initialized in the base class, the functions that are created 
in the derived class also become virtual which allows me to decide which functions to 
use during run-time. This method made my assignments a lot easier than confusing what 
is called when I call the same function in different classes. 
Finally, I was really weak about input and output operator using istream and ostream.
This was really confusing at the first time but after I got used to what those functions
are for and how it is implemented in the program, I was able to use that not only in
milestone for this course but also in DBS final project. Thank you for your lessons.
