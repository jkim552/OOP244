The main topic about this project was allocated a memory array and deallocating it so that it doesn’t make memory error. 
This project allowed me to practice more when to allocate a new memory and when to deallocate after the memory is no longer use. 
Also, assigning that array to null pointer to make sure it doesn’t have any memory assigned. 
Challenging part was m_wrap didn’t have an assigned length of array. 
So I had to create a new structure and allocate each memory using for loop after getting the m_wrapLayers value. 
And assign that memory to m_wrap using m_pattern memory.
