I always have problems when I modify my old code to update new data.
and I figured out that the problem was how I align my functions.
For my next projects and labs I should align the function by where and when
the function is used. I had to go back and forth to see if I made corrections
but the functions were far apart which I got confused time to time.
Using dynamic allocated array of characters is now familar because of the labs
we did so far. I was able to review the notes and my old projects to double
check for memory leak. Constructor and deconstructor example helped me 
understand when to put the deconstructor.
